# BachelorThesis
This Thesis is about assessing TabPFN's vulnerability towards membership inference attacks.

As reference for membership inference attack I used the approach from the following paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03570

The paper also includes a coding example:

The formal use of TabPFN has been introduced in this paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01848

Additionally they have provided coding examples.

Datasets:
The datasets have been retrived from the OpenML database.
In this project the focus lays on supervised learning e.g. classification. 
I mainly focused on datasets that contain medical, sensitive information.

For now, i have settled for 5 datasets to apply a training with TabPFN:
1) Hepatitis: 55
2) Diabetes: 37
3) Breast Cancer: 15
4) Heartstatlo: 53
5) Bloodtransfusion: 1464
